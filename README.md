## Module 8 Journal

**1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.**  
The Gaming Room wanted to expand their game "Draw IT Or Lose It beyond Android. They needed recommendations for platforms, system architecture, storage, and memory management that could scale with lots of users. Through this I was able to learn a lot about each, even the cloud, or serverless architecture. 

**2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**  
I think I did well at breaking down technical details into plain language so it was easier to explain to a client. I also like to add real world examples here and there. This helps me understand what it is I'm learning and allows me to look at things in a different light. I think about the games I play, the servers at my work center, and anything else I can actually relate to. 

**3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful?**  
Well, I initially filled out the entire document, which I don't believe I was required to. So, the first iteration, version 1, took a long time (not the best at reading directions). I found the way it was organized helpful. 

**4. If you could choose one part of your work to revise, what would you pick?**  
I’d probably go back and expand the evaluation table with more real-world examples. I added some, but more detail would’ve made it stronger. The same thing can be said for the recommendations section. 

**5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your design?**  
I looked at the requirements from the client’s perspective — scalability, cross-platform, and security. Keeping those in mind made it easier to recommend Linux and cloud storage.

**6. How did you approach designing software?**  
I tried to think about how all the pieces work together instead of in isolation. In the future, I would break things down into smaller sections and use as many supporting documents/references as possible to ensure the right decisions are made. Proper planning is crucial for huge projects like building a video game. I'm a huge Halo fan, and seeing the way Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) launched Halo 5 and Halo Infinite hurts my brain. These projects require insanely detailed planning and execution.
